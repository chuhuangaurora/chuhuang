Hi there! My name is Huang Chu and you can call me Aurora. I’m currently pursuing my undergraduate degree in Energy and Power Engineering at Hunan University. 

   Academics
---
   Over the past three years, my academic performance has steadily improved and I have consistently **ranked first** in major courses such as <var>Engineering Fluid Mechanics, Materials Mechanics, and Combustion</var>. Because of my excellent academic performance, I was awarded:
   - the Academic Scholarship (2021)
   - the School Second Class Scholarship (2022)
   - the School Outstanding Student Award (2023)
   - the School First Class Scholarship (2023)
   - the School Outstanding Graduate Award (2024)

   Meanwhile, during my internship at <var>Yuchai Machinery Group Co. LTD</var>, I won the Outstanding Intern Award owing to my work ethic.

   Scientific Research
---
   Speaking of scientific research, I think my **open-mindedness** and **proactive attitude** are my greatest strengths. Since my freshman year, I have actively engaged with professors across a diversity of research domains, establishing connections and participating in academic projects. 
   
   At the end of my sophomore year, I successfully applied for a **national-level science and technology innovation project** titled <var>“Preparation and Optimization Design of High-Performance Aerogels”</var>. The project aims to discover the aerogel with optimal thermal insulation properties by adding different amounts of opacifying agents and determine its insulating performance through testing. This project is currently in progress and is expected to be completed next April. 
   
   In my junior year, I independently proposed a research topic and embarked on an in-depth investigation under the guidance of [<var>Prof. Yinjie Ma</var>](http://grjl.hnu.edu.cn/p/5BD5B9EF04D7DC1EE81FB1E3358E034B). In this study, we proposed a novel ester coolant for battery immersion cooling systems by experiment and compared its insulating performance with other coolants by simulation. Eventually, I **submitted a paper as the first author** to the <var>Energy</var>, and it was successfully published in 2023.

   Extra-curricular Activities
---
   As for extra-curricular activities, I prefer fishing. Even if I get nothing, I still regard it as a nice mental reset and a great social tool. Through fishing, I have met many excellent senior citizens and learned knowledge from various fields. 
   
  
   Besides, I like watching football matches because I think football has its unique ability to unite people from different cultures, backgrounds, and languages under a common passion. This aligns with my motivation for pursuing my Doctor's degree abroad.
