* Project Description: This project focused on studying three types of renewable energy feedstocks, including lignocellulosic biomass, starch/sugary biomass, and residues/bio-wastes. It involved defining and analyzing their chemical structures and corresponding biomass conversion technologies. A comparative analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of utilizing these three biomass feedstocks was also conducted.
* Responsibilities: Collaborated with team members to consult relevant literature; Organized group discussions to brainstorm ideas and finalize the structure of the research paper; Acquired a comprehensive understanding of clean energy technologies and analyzed the system aspects of renewable energy technologies; Independently authored the section on starch/sugary biomass in the research paper; Utilized research tools to write a professional report on the design, operation, integration, or economics of a selected system.
