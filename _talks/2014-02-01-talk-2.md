* Project Description: Due to the findings that aerogels can be utilized in energy storage and aerospace applications, this project aimed to explore aerogels with excellent thermal insulation properties and the ability to block infrared thermal radiation from the environment through experimental and numerical simulation methods. Furthermore, the thermal insulation performance of the aerogel was validated through performance testing.
* Responsibilities: Conducted extensive literature review and analysis to develop experimental plans; Organized team discussions and brainstorming sessions; Prepared aerogels with high stability and thermal insulation properties by incorporating different amounts of opacifying agents; Tested the thermal insulation performance of the synthesized silica aerogels and proposed improvement measures; Won the national level project award.
